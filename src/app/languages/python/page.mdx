# üêç Beginner Python Tutorial + Learning Roadmap

## üéØ Why Learn Python?

Python is a beginner-friendly programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It‚Äôs used in web development, data science, AI, automation, game development, and more.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Python Learning Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Basics of Python (Weeks 1‚Äì2)**

Learn the fundamentals to build a strong foundation.

#### Topics:

- Installing Python & using an IDE (e.g., VS Code, Thonny, or Replit)
- Print statements and comments
- Variables and data types
- Basic math operations
- Input and output
- Strings and string manipulation

#### Example:

```python
name = input("What‚Äôs your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

---

### **Phase 2: Control Flow (Weeks 3‚Äì4)**

Learn how to make decisions and repeat actions.

#### Topics:

- `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Comparison and logical operators
- Loops: `for` and `while`
- Loop control: `break` and `continue`

#### Example:

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```

---

### **Phase 3: Data Structures (Weeks 5‚Äì6)**

Understand how to organize and work with collections of data.

#### Topics:

- Lists and list methods
- Tuples
- Dictionaries
- Sets
- Looping through data structures

#### Example:

```python
fruits = {"apple": 3, "banana": 5}
for fruit, count in fruits.items():
    print(f"{fruit}: {count}")
```

---

### **Phase 4: Functions and Modules (Weeks 7‚Äì8)**

Start organizing your code and reusing it effectively.

#### Topics:

- Defining and calling functions
- Function arguments and return values
- Built-in functions
- Importing modules (`math`, `random`, etc.)

#### Example:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```

---

### **Phase 5: Error Handling & File Handling (Week 9)**

Learn to make your programs robust and handle real-world data.

#### Topics:

- Try/except blocks
- Reading from and writing to files

#### Example:

```python
try:
    with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
    print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found.")
```

---

### **Phase 6: Object-Oriented Programming (Week 10+)**

Understand the core concept of modern programming.

#### Topics:

- Classes and objects
- Attributes and methods
- `__init__` method (constructor)
- Inheritance

#### Example:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def bark(self):
        print(self.name + " says woof!")

dog1 = Dog("Buddy")
dog1.bark()
```

---

## üß† Bonus Topics (Optional Advanced Stuff)

- Working with APIs
- GUI programming (Tkinter)
- Web development (Flask or Django)
- Data science (pandas, matplotlib, NumPy)
- Automation (Selenium, pyautogui)

---

## üîß Practice Ideas for Beginners

- Calculator
- To-do list app (CLI)
- Number guessing game
- Rock, Paper, Scissors game
- Simple text-based adventure game
