          Upgrading a slow computer can significantly improve its performance or
          storage capacity and extend its lifespan. At Te Atatu Computers, we do
          profesional computer upgrades, wheather you need more storage or have
          a slow device. Increasing the RAM allows your system to handle more
          tasks simultaneously, reducing lag and boosting speed. Replacing an
          old hard drive (HDD) with a solid-state drive (SSD) can dramatically
          decrease boot times and make file access much faster, thanks to the
          SSD&apos;s superior data transfer speeds. Additionally, optimizing your
          Windows operating system—by removing unnecessary startup programs,
          updating drivers, and cleaning up system files—can further enhance
          your computer&apos;s responsiveness. These upgrades are cost-effective
          solutions to breathe new life into your device and improve your
          productivity.
